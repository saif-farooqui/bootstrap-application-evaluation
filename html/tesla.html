						<div class="content">
							<p>Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to compromise to drive electric – that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, Tesla builds not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Tesla believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.</p>
							<p>Tesla’s vehicles are produced at its factory in Fremont, California, where the vast majority of the vehicle’s components are also made. As Tesla continues to expand its product line, Tesla’s production plan is also set to increase to a rate of 500,000 vehicles a year by 2018.</p>

								<h3>Roadster 2008</h3>
								<p>On a wet public road, with mediocre traction, we measured a 0-to-60-mph time of 4.4 seconds (shifting at 62 mph) and a quarter-mile of 13.3 seconds at 104 mph (shifting at 45 mph, which is what’s represented in our spec panel).</p>

								<h3>Roadster 2020</h3>
								<p>The electric motor is reportedly capable of producing 7,376 pound-feet of torque (!), thus allowing for the sub-two-second 0-60 time, a top speed of 250-plus miles per hour (402 kmh), all while returning an impressive 620 miles (997 kilometers) of range on the highway. Again, we remain skeptical.</p>
